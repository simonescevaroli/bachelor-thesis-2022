This repo holds my thesis for my Bachelor's Degree in _Computer, Communication and Electronic Engineering_ at the Universit√† di Trento, in 2022. <br>
It focuses on studying, developing and testing a way to leverage techniques created for neural networks (namely backpropagation), together with evolutionary computation, to optimize interpretable machine learning models, such as decision trees.
